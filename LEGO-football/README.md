Run "run_LEGO_SW" and "LEGO_SW" in order to launch the project. Simulation results can be exported from the Scope(s), or load the sample results from "Simulation logs".
Script "animate_results_3D" is my own project contribution/extension to help visualize the simulation results more intuitively (uses simulation results^ as inputs)
